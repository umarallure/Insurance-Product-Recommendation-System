Here's a breakdown of the application's logic:

1. Overall Structure (src/App.tsx and src/pages/Index.tsx)

The main application entry point is src/main.tsx, which renders the App component.
src/App.tsx sets up the React Router for navigation, including a route for the home page (/) which renders the Index component, and a catch-all * route for NotFound. It also initializes QueryClientProvider and TooltipProvider, and includes Toaster and Sonner components for notifications.
src/pages/Index.tsx is a simple wrapper that renders the InsuranceQualifier component. This means the entire core logic of the application resides within InsuranceQualifier.

2. Core Qualification Logic (src/components/InsuranceQualifier.tsx)
This component manages the entire insurance qualification flow.

State Management:

products: Fetched from the useInsuranceData hook, this array holds all available insurance products, each with its tier, description, benefits, and disqualifying_questions.
loading, error: Also from useInsuranceData, indicating data fetching status.
state (QualificationState): This local state object tracks the user's progress through the qualification process:
currentProductIndex: Index of the product currently being evaluated.
askedQuestions: A Set to keep track of questions already asked to avoid repetition.
currentQuestionIndex: Index of the current question within the disqualifying_questions array of the currentProduct.
qualifiedProduct: Stores the InsuranceProduct if the user qualifies for one, otherwise null.
isComplete: A boolean indicating if the qualification process has finished.
responses: An object to store user responses to questions (though currently, it's not fully utilized for persistence beyond the session).
currentQuestion: The actual question text displayed to the user.
showIntro: A boolean to control the display of the introductory screen.
Flow:

Initial Load: When the component mounts, it fetches insurance product data using useInsuranceData. It displays a loading spinner or an error message based on the data fetching status.
Introduction Screen: If showIntro is true, it displays an introduction card listing the available insurance products and a "Start Qualification Process" button.
Qualification Process:
When "Start Qualification Process" is clicked, showIntro becomes false.
The component iterates through products based on currentProductIndex.
For each product, it iterates through its disqualifying_questions.
getUniqueQuestionsForCurrentProduct() ensures that only questions relevant to the current product and not yet asked are presented.
handleAnswer(answer: boolean):
If the user answers true (meaning they have the disqualifying condition), the application calls moveToNextProduct(), effectively disqualifying them from the current product and moving to the next tier.
If the user answers false (meaning they do not have the disqualifying condition), the application proceeds to the next question for the current product. If all questions for the current product are answered "No", the user qualifies for that product, and the isComplete state is set to true with the qualifiedProduct.
User responses are stored in the local responses state and also attempted to be saved to Supabase via saveResponse (though the current implementation notes a lack of question IDs for proper database saving).
Completion Screen: Once isComplete is true, it displays either a "Congratulations!" message with the qualified product's details or a "No Qualifying Products" message. It also provides a "Start Over" button to restart the process.
Progress Tracking:

getTotalProgress(): Calculates overall progress based on the number of unique questions asked across all products. This seems to be a global progress indicator.
The UI also shows progress for the current product's questions (e.g., "Question 1 of 5").
3. Data Fetching (src/hooks/useInsuranceData.ts)

This custom hook is responsible for fetching insurance product data and their associated disqualifying questions from Supabase.
It uses useState for products, loading, and error states.
The useEffect hook performs an asynchronous data fetch from two Supabase tables: insurance_products and disqualifying_questions.
It then combines the fetched products with their respective disqualifying questions by filtering questions based on product_id.
The order clause in the Supabase queries suggests that products are ordered by tier and questions by question_order.
4. Session Management and Persistence (src/hooks/useQualificationSession.ts)

This custom hook manages a unique session ID for each qualification attempt using uuidv4.
saveResponse(questionId: string, response: boolean): This function is intended to save individual user responses to the user_responses table in Supabase. However, the current implementation in InsuranceQualifier.tsx notes that questionId is not available, and responses are only saved locally to the component's state. This is a critical point for data persistence.
saveResult(qualifiedProductId: string | null): This function saves the final qualification result (the ID of the qualified product or null if none) to the qualification_results table in Supabase.
5. Supabase Integration (src/integrations/supabase/client.ts and src/integrations/supabase/types.ts)

src/integrations/supabase/client.ts initializes the Supabase client with a hardcoded URL and publishable key.
src/integrations/supabase/types.ts defines the TypeScript types for the Supabase database schema, including tables like disqualifying_questions, insurance_products, qualification_results, and user_responses. These types are crucial for type-safe interactions with the Supabase client.

Key Observations and Potential Areas for Improvement:

Question ID for saveResponse: The InsuranceQualifier.tsx component explicitly mentions that questionId is not available when calling saveResponse. The disqualifying_questions table in Supabase does have an id column. The useInsuranceData hook fetches question_text but doesn't seem to store the id of the questions in the InsuranceProduct interface or the products state. This would need to be addressed if individual question responses are to be properly persisted in the database.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is present for data fetching, but more granular error messages or user feedback could be implemented for Supabase operations within the saveResponse and saveResult functions.
User Experience: The current flow is linear. Depending on the complexity of the insurance products, a more dynamic or branching question flow might be beneficial, though this would significantly increase complexity.
Scalability of Questions: If the number of disqualifying questions becomes very large, the current approach of fetching all questions for all products at once might become inefficient.
UI/UX: The UI components are well-structured using Shadcn UI, which provides a good foundation.
